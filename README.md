# Variable-Stars
Using TESS data and extracting it using python plugins like lightkurve and astropy ive plotted the light curves and using the lomb-scargle periodogram one can find out the time period of one dimming cycle of the star. ive taken 15 such stars with varying periods and types of variability and compiled my findings in a 33 page report.
